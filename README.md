This is the software side of the avionics project for the Rocket Launchers 2018-2019. This software is able to to receive signals from the telemetry components from the rocket and save and display the information on a screen. The information displayed is displayed in different formats through different screens which you can switch between. The information recieved is also saved on a local server that updates the data in real time which any device can tune in and display it on their side independently from the main monitor.
